# Algolia VanillaJS Demo
## Installation
Use the recommended node version (`.nvmrc`). If you have `nvm` then run `nvm use` to load the corresponding node version automatically.

## Configuration
It is recommended to use the default configurations for testing the integration with your website first (see the **Installing the Algolia Prototype in your website section**). Once it's working, proceed with the corresponding configuration from the Algolia dashboard.

Once the Index configuration is ready, proceed to update the code as follows:
1. Update your Algolia credentials and indices configurations located within `src/js/algoliaConfig.js`.
2. Update the Autocomplete `itemTemplate` function to match your record's attributes (`src/js/autocomplete.js`.
3. Update the `itemTemplate` function to match your record's attributes (`src/instantSearch.js`).
## Local Development
Run `npm run start` to get the local server running. This server will refresh anytime your code is updated.

> The `searchPagePath` configuration variable is going to be used to connect your search bar with your search page. The URL redirection will not be used in ***Local Development*** but once your assets are exported and installed, the configured `searchPagePath` will be used to redirect users to the specified results page.

## Installing the Algolia prototype in your website
### 1. Export Compiled Assets
Export the corresponding code assets by running `npm run build`. It will produce 4 files within the `dist` folder.
- `algolia-search-bar.css` Styles for Search Bar (Autocomplete).
- `algolia-search-bar.js` Script for Search Bar (Autocomplete).
- `algolia-search-results.css` Styles for Search Results Page (InstantSearch).
- `algolia-search-results.js` Script for SSearch Results Page (InstantSearch).

Make sure you upload all the files in your web platform so they can be located using URLs.
> We'll use `ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL` as a reference for the URL you'll use to upload your assets.

### 2. Add the search bar.
  - a) Within your platform, locate the place where your Navigation Bar is located (or wherever you want to add the search bar) and include the following code.
  ```html
      <div id="autocomplete__container" ></div>
  ```
  - b) Include the css so it can be loaded every time the search bar is loaded. Use your corresponding `ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL` URL where you upoaded the `algolia-search-bar.css` file.
   > There is usually a template/section where other external css and js files are added globally.
  ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL}/algolia-search-bar.css">
  ```
  - c) Include the `algolia-search-bar.js` script so it can be loaded every time the search bar is laoded. Use your corresponding `ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL` URL where you upoaded the `algolia-search-bar.js` file.
  > There is usually a template/section where other external css and js files are added globally.
```html
  <script src="{ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL}/algolia-search-bar.js" type="module"></script>
```
### 3. Add the search results section.
- a) Within your platform, locate the Results Page section that renders the results and include the following markup.
  ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL}/algolia-search-results.css">

    <!-- InstantSearch containers!! BEGINNING-->
    <div class="ais__main-container">
      <div class="ais__main-container--header">
        <button class="filters-trigger__btn"><span class="flters-trigger__count"></span></button>
        <button class="filters-close__btn">Ã—</span></button>
        <div id="sort-by__container"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="ais__main-container--content">
        <div class="ais__main-container--left">
          <div id="current-refinements"></div>
          <div id="facets__container"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="ais__main-container--center">
          <div id="searchbox__container" class="pb-2"></div>
          <div id="hits-default__container"></div>
          <div id="hits-non-results__container"></div>
          <div id="pagination" class="p-8 text-center"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- InstantSearch containers!! END -->

    <script src="{ALGOLIA_ASSETS_URL}/algolia-search-results.js" type="module"></script>
  ```
  > If you can, place the `<script>` and `<link`> tag in the dedicated sections for scripts and styles of the search page (We added all at the same place for simplicity).
